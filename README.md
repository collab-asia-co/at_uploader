# Art Track Uploader

## Process

The copyright scraper was created for DDEX certification, and does the following 
1) Reads from an input csv of Asset IDs that have Sound Recording Assets but no corresponding Art Track Assets
2) Opens up a chrome driver that, for each asset, downloads the SR recording as an Mp3 file
